  <h2>Recent Getaway</h2>
  This semester, I studied abroad in London. I was very fortunate to travel to
  a lot of places. My favorite place I traveled to was Barcelona. I swam in
  the mediterranean, ate tapas, and took a four hour bike tour around the city.
  It was so beautiful and I really hope to go back!
  <h2>Animal Names</h2>
  <ul>
        <li>White Bunny: Alaska</li>
        <li>Blue-eyed Husky: Jack</li>
        <li>Black and white cat: Macavity</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Restaurant</h2>
  My favorite restaurant is
  <a href="https://sticksnsushi.com/en">Sticks N' Sushi</a>
  . The owner of the restaurant's mom is Japanese and their dad is Danish.
  I love seafood and the fish is always fresh. I usually get the Pink Alaska
  roll, Seaweed Salad, and a Miso Cod stick. They have locations in London and 
  Copenhagen. My favorite location is in Copenhagen because it is on the roof
  and has a beautiful view of the city. The restaurant is a bit expensive but 
  it is perfect for a special occasion!

  My favorite food is fresh tomatoes. I like to eat them with salt, olive oil,
  and balsamic vinegar. I also enjoy cooked tomatoes, tomato soup, and fresh 
  tomatoes on pizza and pasta. I will eat a tomato in any form!
